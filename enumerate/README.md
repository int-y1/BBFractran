# Fractran enumerators

## Build instructions

Currently, only Windows is supported. Sorry, Linux users.

First, install gmp. Then this command will build and run the program.

```
./ac fractran20251107
```

The program will write to 2 locations:

* stderr will show information to help with debugging the enumerator.
* The file `fractran.txt` contains the output of the enumeration. This file is intended to be studied further or shared.
