# Fractran enumerators

## Build instructions

Currently, only Windows is supported. Sorry, Linux users.

These commands will build and run the program. `ac_old` requires GMP to be installed. `ac` does not require GMP.

```
./ac_old fractran20251107
./ac fractran20251113
./ac fractran20251116
```

The program will write to 2 locations:

* stderr will show information to help with debugging the enumerator.
* The file `fractran.txt` contains the output of the enumeration. This file is intended to be studied further or shared.
